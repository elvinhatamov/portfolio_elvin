# üöÄ Alternative AWS Deployment: S3 + CloudFront

## Since Amplify is having issues, let's deploy using AWS S3 directly!

This approach will:
- ‚úÖ Get your portfolio live on AWS immediately
- ‚úÖ Show your hands-on AWS skills
- ‚úÖ Be more cost-effective than Amplify
- ‚úÖ Give you full control over the deployment

---

## üìã **Step-by-Step S3 Deployment:**

### **Step 1: Create S3 Bucket**

1. **Go to**: [AWS S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. **Click**: "Create bucket"
3. **Bucket name**: `elvin-hatamov-portfolio` (must be globally unique)
4. **Region**: Choose closest to you (e.g., `us-east-1`)
5. **Uncheck**: "Block all public access" ‚ö†Ô∏è
6. **Check**: "I acknowledge that the current settings..."
7. **Click**: "Create bucket"

### **Step 2: Enable Static Website Hosting**

1. **Click**: Your bucket name
2. **Go to**: "Properties" tab
3. **Scroll down**: To "Static website hosting"
4. **Click**: "Edit"
5. **Enable**: Static website hosting
6. **Index document**: `index.html`
7. **Error document**: `index.html` (for React routing)
8. **Click**: "Save changes"

### **Step 3: Set Bucket Policy**

1. **Go to**: "Permissions" tab
2. **Scroll to**: "Bucket policy"
3. **Click**: "Edit"
4. **Paste this policy** (replace `elvin-hatamov-portfolio` with your bucket name):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::elvin-hatamov-portfolio/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

5. **Click**: "Save changes"

### **Step 4: Upload Your Built Files**

I've already built your project locally. Now:

1. **Go to**: "Objects" tab in your S3 bucket
2. **Click**: "Upload"
3. **Drag and drop**: ALL files from your `build` folder
   - From: `D:\files (1)\build\*`
   - Make sure to upload the folder structure, not just files
4. **Click**: "Upload"

### **Step 5: Get Your Website URL**

1. **Go back**: "Properties" tab
2. **Scroll to**: "Static website hosting"
3. **Copy**: The "Bucket website endpoint" URL
4. **Test**: Your live portfolio!

## üéØ **Automated Upload Script**

I'll create a PowerShell script to automate the upload:

```powershell
# Make sure you have AWS CLI installed and configured
aws s3 sync ./build s3://elvin-hatamov-portfolio --delete
aws s3 website s3://elvin-hatamov-portfolio --index-document index.html --error-document index.html
```

## üìà **Why This Approach is Better for You:**

‚úÖ **Direct AWS experience** - Shows hands-on S3 knowledge  
‚úÖ **Cost-effective** - S3 hosting costs ~$1-5/month  
‚úÖ **Full control** - You understand every step  
‚úÖ **Easy updates** - Simple file upload or AWS CLI sync  
‚úÖ **Interview ready** - Can explain the entire architecture  

---

## üîß **Next Steps After S3:**

1. **Add CloudFront** (CDN for global performance)
2. **Custom domain** setup with Route 53
3. **SSL certificate** with AWS Certificate Manager
4. **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions

But for now, let's get your portfolio live with basic S3 hosting!

## üí° **Quick Alternative: Netlify**

If you want something working RIGHT NOW:

1. **Go to**: [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. **Drag and drop**: Your `build` folder
3. **Live in 30 seconds!**

But AWS S3 will showcase your cloud skills better for job interviews.
