              I'm a Cloud Computing postgraduate student at George Brown College with over 3+ years of experience as a 
              Full Stack and Web Developer, plus 1.5+ years specializing in Cloud Computing. I've contributed to 30+ projects 
              using technologies like React, Node.js, Azure, AWS, and Microsoft 365.

              During my internship as a Research Assistant at Lambton College, I worked on cloud-based applications 
              where I gained experience with AWS services, deployed applications using Docker, and collaborated using 
              Git for version control. This role helped me strengthen my skills in cloud architecture, containerization, 
              and CI/CD pipelines.

            <p>
              I also volunteered with Out in Tech, where I helped build a community platform for Key Watch Ghana. 
              As a freelancer, I launched e-commerce websites for clients using Shopify and WordPress, focusing on 
              clean design, SEO, and user experience.

            <p>
              Prior to my tech journey, I worked as a Sales Representative in the pharmaceutical industry and 
              supported clients as an immigration consultant. These experiences taught me how to communicate 
              effectively, adapt quickly, and solve problemsâ€”skills I now apply to cloud-focused projects.
