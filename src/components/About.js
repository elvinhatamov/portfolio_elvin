              I'm a Cloud Computing postgraduate student at George Brown College with hands-on experience in 
              Microsoft 365, Azure, and AWS. I've contributed to cloud-integrated and web-based projects using 
              tools like React, Node.js, Azure Virtual Machines, AWS RDS, and Microsoft Endpoint Manager.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my internship as a Research Assistant at Lambton College, I worked on cloud-based applications 
              where I gained experience with AWS services, deployed applications using Docker, and collaborated using 
              Git for version control. This role helped me strengthen my skills in cloud architecture, containerization, 
              and CI/CD pipelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also volunteered with Out in Tech, where I helped build a community platform for Key Watch Ghana. 
              As a freelancer, I launched e-commerce websites for clients using Shopify and WordPress, focusing on 
              clean design, SEO, and user experience.

            <p>
              Prior to my tech journey, I worked as a Sales Representative in the pharmaceutical industry and 
              supported clients as an immigration consultant. These experiences taught me how to communicate 
              effectively, adapt quickly, and solve problemsâ€”skills I now apply to cloud-focused projects.
